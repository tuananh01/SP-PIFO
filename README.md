## My implementation
About the simulation environment, I use the latest Development VM which has necessary P4 developement tools provided here: https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/blob/master/bin/README-install-troubleshooting.md
<br>
I clone p4-learing repository (https://github.com/nsg-ethz/p4-learning/tree/master) to the VM and using that repo to run exercise.
